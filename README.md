## Student Technology Hour Manager

If you're new to django, please check out [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django), as you'll learn everything you need to know there.

### Info:

* Make sure all apps handle their own url dispatching. Check out "/hour_manager/urls.py" for details on how to do this.

* All static files belong in "/static/", as denoted in "/settings.py".

* This uses military time, as that is the easiest way for the database models to *handle* the time. This should not be changed, or attempted to be changed.
